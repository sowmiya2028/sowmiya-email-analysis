## Project Description 📈

The main objective of Kata4 is to process a text file containing email addresses and generate a histogram that shows the frequency of each email domain in the list. The program follows the Input, Process, Output (IPO) design pattern, where:

- **Input:** The program reads email addresses from a file named `email.txt`.
  
- **Process:** After reading the email addresses, the program processes the information to build a histogram that counts the frequency of each email domain.

- **Output:** Finally, the program displays the generated histogram in a graphical interface.

## How to Use 🚀

1. Clone or download the project to your development environment.

2. Ensure that you have the JFreeChart library in your project to visualize the histogram.

3. Run the `Kata4.java` class to start the application.

4. Observe the generated histogram in the graphical interface.

## Email File Configuration ⚙️

Ensure that the `email.txt` file is located in the path specified in the `input` method of the `Kata4.java` class. This file should contain a list of email addresses, and the program will ignore lines that do not contain "@".

**Note:** This project assumes you are using NetBeans as your development environment. Make sure to adjust file paths according to your environment if you are using a different IDE.
